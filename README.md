# 3D-Rubik-cube-Three.js
 Individual graduate course work; 3D Rubik's Cube using JavaScript libraries that is Three.js.
 
## Overview
The primary objective of this project, is to solve the Rubik’s cube, to solve Rubik’s cube the slab of cube are first rotated in random way. To do so we could have three level i.e. level 1: 10 rotation, level 2: 20 rotations, and level 3: 30 rotations. Then, the user can rotate the entire cube to see its faces, but also do a rotation in a slab. This project provides two features to solve 3x3x3 Rubik’s cube:

i)	Rotate the entire cube: the user can define a rotation vector by clicking outside the cube, and do a movement with the mouse, defining the rotation vector. <br />
ii)	Rotate a slab: the user can click on any visible slab, and do a drag with the mouse, defining the movement. The slab will move in the mouse direction.

The game finished when the cube is solved (all faces contains one color) or when the user click on restart button. The interface will contain only three Dat.GUI controls:

i)	Restart button. <br />
ii)	 Choose level (1,2,3). <br />
iii)	Change the size of Rubik’s cube (3x3x3,4x4x4).
